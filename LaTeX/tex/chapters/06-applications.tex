maybe how this works with respect to pathfinding, who we should select in a set of opponents if we only have to play a single opponent in the set.
If we can score an average of 3.8 against op1 or 3 against op2, we play op2 etc.

game shows to win money?
We want to win as much money as possible but we don't mind how much our opponent wins, as long as we get lots.

What were actually doing is finding a sequence that will manipulate our opponent into providing us the most number of cooperation moves we can subsequently defect against.
Failing that we are manipulating the opponent for cooperation moves we can cooperate against, then defection moves we can defect against, then defection moves we must cooperate for.
