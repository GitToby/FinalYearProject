The Prisoners Dilemma is a classic game theory topic

    \section{Background}
        \subsection{Game Theory}
        fill this section in when I do the course?
        \subsection{Iterated Prisoners Dilemma}
        The Prisoners Dilemma is a well known game theory problem based on the example of a pair of prisoners and their subsequent interrogation. The game is as follows:\\ 

        Something about the PD \\ 

        The single game itself is very basic and is modeled in the following way: \\ 

        $$give-a-model-here$$

        The Iterated Prisoners Dilemma is the iterated version of the Prisoners Dilemma\footnote{reference this stuff dude, come on..}. The iteration of the game is what makes the game an intresting concept, as now \textbf{learn the technical stuff and put it here!!!!!}
        
        \subsection{Machine Learning Concepts}
        This section will briefly provide a background to machine learning algorithms implemented in the axelrod-dojo\footnote{referencing opportunity here}. This is by no means a comprehensive look into these subjects but will provide sufficient background on technical discussion later on.
            \subsubsection{Genetic Algorithms}
            % rephrase this section
            Genetic Algorithms are a description of techniques for generating solutions complex problems such as searching and, in our case, optimization\footnote{Mitchell, Melanie (1996). An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. ISBN 9780585030944. learn to reference soon}. The basis of a genetic algorithm is focused on a cycle of evolution. Like nature, we create a survival of the fittest concept\footnote{need to reference Darwin?} to evaluate a population, kill off the weakest members and create offspring from the most successful population.\\
            
            Put a figure of the cycle here. \label{fig:genetic algo cycle} \\
                       
            Initially we create a heuristic function, say our fitness function, which is a measure of how successful a candidate in our population is. Then we run our whole population through this function, ranking each one by how successful their score is. At this point we can create a cut off\footnote{Can often be referred to as the bottleneck} to decide which of the population not to put through to the next round.\\ 

            

            \subsubsection{Bayesian Optimization}

    \section{Brief Overview}
    In this document I will be be looking at the creation of sequences to beat given players in The Iterated Prisoners Dilemma\footnote{Reference this for some background}. My research looked into just the single opponent use case, but the idea of designing a sequence for a given number of opponents is looked at in the further study of the report

    Problem:\\
    Given a certain opponent, O, (with a provided strategy, S) what is the best possible sequence of moves, in a game of n turns, made by my strategy to maximise my players score?
