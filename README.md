This is the edit for github to make Toby happy in the future.
 
Things ive read so far:
- a bunch of stuff
    - the articles below
    - ch.1 and ch.2 of the book *The Complexity of Cooperation*
    - far too many bits of documentation
- the multi version can be modeled as a group of people eating ()
- worked through some examples (see scratch code file)
- looked into the Dojo and pulled it down as a dev package

## Main problem
Here I will look into the problem that I have been asked to solve.
#### Problem:
*Given a certain opponent, O, (with a provided strategy, S) what is the best possible sequence of moves, in a game of n 
turns, made by my strategy to maximise my players score?*

Examples of solutions include:
Opponent  | Sequence
----------|---------
Cooperator| D,D,D,D,D,D,...
Defector  | D,D,D,D,D,D,...
TitForTat | C,C,C,C,C,C,...

How do we generate this sequence for each opponent? idk yet, but I'll let you know
