# Final Year Project

This is the repository for my 20 credit project during my final year at cardiff university.
The project involves researching the best responses to strategies in the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma.


My code is split into 2 sections, code and report.
The code section contains examples and notebooks used for research.
The Latex section contains the final report source and compiled pdf.
